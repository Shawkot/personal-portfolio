        <li><strong>Webpage of a coding learning site</strong></li>
            <p>In this project, I have designed a webpage for a coding site. They teach different
            programming language.<br>This project was a learning outcome of my course on Codecademy. 
            I build this webpage from scratch.<br> I was given only the requirement and I build the webpage
            within one day only! <br>If you are interested, please visit
            <a href="codebinary.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see the
            website page</p>

        <li><strong>Cupful Cafe's website</strong></li>
            <p>Cupful cafe is a restaurent and also a fast-food shop, where people can buy
            foods and can also enjoy thier time.<br> The owner of the shop like to make their own website so that
            people can find them online, view thir recent offer,<br> trending program and so on. I designed
            thier webpage from scratch and this was another project <br>from my learning outcome of
            "How to make  a website with Namecheap.<br><a href="#" target="_blank">Here </a>is the link of that site, 
            have a 
            look if you are interested!</p>

        <li><strong>Building my own Portfolio</strong></li>
            <p>My portfolio is also designed and developed be me using HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap.<br>
            I build this website from scratch within two days only. It was a great achievement for me,<br>
            because I don't have any prior knowledge about building website but I made it! <br>Still I am working
            on it to make my website more attractive.</p>

            <p><strong>Course 1: Python Basics for Data Analysis</strong></p>
            <p class="para">In this course, I learn about the basics of Python for data analysis.<br>
            I am interested in data sciecne and for this python is must.<br> Though I had some
            basic knowledge on Python, I came to <br>know something new in this course. This course
            is offered by <br>"Openclassroom". I worked on "Jupyter Notebook" in this course <br>
            and build a "Apelette" game by python.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Course 3: Software Development Process</strong></p>
            <p class="para">This course was offered by udacity and it was a amazing course.<br>
            Every software engineer and developer should know about the concept discussed here. As I'm not from computer sciecne background,<br>
            I found  this course very very effective. In this course, various software development life cycle model such as "Water Fall" model,
           "V-model", "Agile" model, "Spiral" model are discussed. They gave a crystal clear view of every model
            and discussed about every phase for any kind of model. Some phase for example. Requirement Engineering (RE),<br> Design, Implementation, Validation
              and Verification, 
              Maintenance etc. 
               are described broadly. This was a wonderful experience for me!</p>

            <p><strong>Course 2: Building Your First Webpage by Using HTML and CSS</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Course 4: Scrum Master Fundamentals - Becoming a Great Scrum Master</strong></p>
            <p class="para">Scrum is a specific framework of "Agile" project management. In this 
            wonderful course provided by Pluralsight, they give a clear concept of 
            project management, what is the difference between Agile and Scrum. Though most of 
            the people think they are same but actually
            they aren't. In this course I learnt about project planning, role of a scrum,
            how to design and choose proper scrum master. Selecting proper sprint and
            how to implement these sprints are the core topic of this course. This course 
            also discuss broadly where scrum fits and where not. The main prerequisite for scrum,
            how to design product vision board and how to keep momentum among team members are also 
            discussed very efficiently in this course. I enjoy this course a lot.</p>
